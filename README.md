# C Stack Simulation (x86)

This is a simple stack simulation written in C to mimic how the CPU handles instructions like `push` and `pop`.

I wrote this after learning how the stack works and playing around with x64dbg.  
I really enjoy writing small emulators for fundamental low-level concepts to understand.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `stack.c` – Contains the stack implementation and a basic test to demonstrate usage.

## 🛠️ Build & Run

```bash
gcc -o stack stack.c
./stack```
